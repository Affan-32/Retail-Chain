# Retail-Chain
The aim of this project is to use Python, SQL, and Excel to analyze sales data and generate meaningful reports for a retail chain.

**Methodology
**
Phase 1: Data Collection and Database Setup

Data Collection
Set up a SQL database to hold the data. Design the database schema, and create the necessary tables using SQL DDL commands.
Phase 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation

Use SQL queries and Python (pandas) to clean the data. Look for and handle missing or inconsistent data, outliers, etc.
Prepare the data for analysis. This may involve creating additional calculated fields, such as total sales value, month/year fields for time-based analysis, etc.
Phase 3: Data Analysis

Use SQL queries and Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc) to explore the data and identify trends and patterns.
Perform more complex analysis as needed. For example, time series analysis for sales trends, cohort analysis for customer behavior, etc.
Phase 4: Reporting

Prepare reports summarizing the findings. These can include: • Tabular Reports • Visual Reports • Automated Reports
Report Presentation: Present the reports to in either your Excel dashboard or prepare a PPT to present the findings
